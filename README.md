# ⚛ Atomic Mass Calculator

A simple Python project that calculates the *molecular/atomic mass* of a given chemical formula (e.g. H2O, CO2, C6H12O6).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Takes a valid chemical formula as input
- Parses the formula to identify atoms and their counts
- Calculates total atomic/molecular mass based on atomic weights
- Supports elements with multi-letter symbols (e.g. Na, Cl, Fe)
- Handles nested formulas like Ca(OH)2

🧠 How It Works
	•	A dictionary stores atomic weights of common elements
	•	The input string is parsed to extract each element and its quantity
	•	Uses Python logic to multiply weights and sum them accurately

---

🛠 Technologies Used
	•	Python 3.x
	•	Built-in modules (no external dependencies)

---

📚 Future Improvements 
	•	GUI with Tkinter or web UI with Flask
	•	Handle isotopes or custom element databases
	•	Input validation and error handling for unknown elements
